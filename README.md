# Choralcreator
My attempt at a choral generator using rules from functional harmony as used by Johann Sebastian Bach.

This project has two goals: 

Goal 1 - Explore how an algorithmic approach can shape music within a genre where rules are strict.
Goal 2 - Reduce the amount of work I have to do in MUSV1017 :)
