    "\n",
    "Main function takes in a melody (Soprano) and optionally a chord progression. It will try to generate a four-part harmony based on the general ruleset followed by Johann Sebastian Bach. These are the rules implemented in this program:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> Avoid consecutive octaves, fifths and unisons.\n",
    "    <li> Avoid movement larger than a fifth for the three highest voices (Soprano, Alto, Tenor).\n",
    "    <li> Maximum distance between voices is an octave for Soprano-Alto, Alto-Tenor, and an an octave+fifth for Tenor-Bass.\n",
    "    <li> If a chord contains the seventh, it has to be resolved downwards (often to the third of the next chord)\n",
    "    <li> Avoid doubling the third in the dominant chord.\n",
    "    <li> \n",
